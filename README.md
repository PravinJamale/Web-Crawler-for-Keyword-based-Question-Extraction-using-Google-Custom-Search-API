A. Project Title: Web-Crawler-for-Keyword-based-Question-Extraction-using-Google-Custom-Search-API.


B. Benefits and Applications:

   1. User Insights: The collected questions shed light on what users are searching for, helping businesses and content creators better understand their target audience's needs and concerns.
   
   2. Data-driven Decision Making: The exported CSV file serves as a valuable resource for data analysis, enabling data-driven decision making in various domains.

   3. Topic Exploration and Research: The extracted questions provide valuable insights into user queries, popular topics, and trends, making it useful for topic exploration and research purposes.
   
   4. Targeted Question Extraction: The project allows users to extract questions specifically related to their chosen keyword from popular websites, saving time and effort in manual searching.


C. Technology Stack:

   1. Programming Language: Python
   
   2. Libraries/Frameworks: Requests, Pandas, JSON


D. Main Steps:

   a. User Input:
      
      1. The project prompts the user to enter a keyword of interest.

   b. Multi-Site Search:

      1. The project appends the specified keyword with site-specific search strings (e.g., "site:quora.com" and "site:wikihow.com").

      2. Specified keywords are used to search on Google using the Google Custom Search API.

   c. Google Custom Search API:

      1. The project sends a network request to the Google Custom Search API, providing the API key and the search query/keyword.

      2. The API responds with the search results in JSON format.

   d. Data Processing: 

      1. The project extracts the total number of search results from the JSON response.

   e. Exception Handling:

      1. The project employs a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur during the processing of search results.
      
   f. Storing and Exporting Data:

      1. The project loops through the responses and extracts the titles (questions) of the search results.
      
      2. It removes unnecessary text (e.g., " - Quora") from the extracted (questions) titles.
      
      3. The extracted questions are stored in a list.
      
      4. The list is converted into a Pandas DataFrame named "df".

      5. The DataFrame is exported to a CSV file with the filename based on the user-specified keyword.
